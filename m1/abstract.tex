The development and widespread of Internet browsers and technologies make them
a tool that can be used for many scientific problems. This raises the question
of whether  Internet browsers, together with WebGPU and WebRTC, can be used to
do scalable computing in a distributed cluster. This thesis answers the
question by implementing a peer-to-peer cluster and testing it with two
problems, Matrix multiplication and  Mandelbrot sets generation. The
experimental results show that computing embarrassingly parallel problems are
scalable with more than 75\% efficiency.
